## CISC 4900 encryption game module.

This is a first prototype of my module made using [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io) HTML5 game framework.

Things that had been done:
* Learned the basics of Phaser3: Loading resources - images spritesheets, creating animation, using "Arcade" physics, scene managemnet, update logic.
* Created two layers of a top-down 2D styled RPG environment to explore using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org "map editor").
* Loaded this environment as a JSON format.
* There are currently 3 scenes: world exploration, turn-based battle, dialog with NPC.
* Hosted the module on [itch.io](https://vladglad.itch.io/phaser-rpg?secret=6ltnySNslGpibAeh8dyZCC8PotI)
* Actual teaching process is to be implemented.

Things to consider during our next meeting:
* Team communication: should consider setting up a group chat.
* How should modules be integrated? Is my module standalone or other consepts could be included within my module? (What role does my module play in the final product?)
* Too ambitious? Follow through with this module or abandon it due to a possible complexity and instead create something simpler - like a visual novel.
