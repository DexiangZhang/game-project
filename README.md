## CISC 4900 encryption game module.

This is a first prototype of my module made using Phaser.io game framework.

Things that had been done:
* Created top-down 2d styled RPG environment (in Tiled) to explore.
* Map loaded into Phaser3 as a JSON format.
* Sprite animations of character movement.
* There are currently 3 scenes: world exploration, battle, dialog with NPC.
* Actual teaching process is to be implemented.

Things to consider during our next meeting:
* Team communication: should consider setting up group chat.
* How should modules be integrated? Is my module standalone or other consepts could be included within my module?
* Follow through with this module or abandon it due to a possible complexity and instead creata something simpler like a visual novel.
